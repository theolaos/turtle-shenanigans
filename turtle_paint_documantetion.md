## Welcome to the documentation of the turtle_paint i made.

### How to use:
	Ways to draw:
	- click on top of the Blue circle and drag it around. You should see it leaving a trail as you move it.
		*if it doesn't leave a trail, then click once again on top of the blue circle.

	- click anywhere else in the canvas so the circle can teleport there, giving you the extra freedom to do more cool paintings
		*When the circle teleports under the position in the canvas, you should click again the circle so you can move it.

	- You can use the arrow keys in your computer to move the circle up,down, left or right
		*You can not go diagnolly, and i am not willing to fix this

		Colors:
		<color> : <key you need to press to access it>
		Black: <k>
		Blue: <b>
		Red: <r>
		Green: <g>

	Extra features:
	- Filling shapes:
		start filling: <f>
		end filling: <e>
	The way it works is by letting you draw the shape you want, then press the key for the end filling
	
	- Clearing your canvas:
		clear canvas: <c>
	As the name suggests, you can clear you current painted scetches by pressing "c"

	- Saving a scetch*:
		start recording the scetch: <p>
		stop recording the scetch: <o>
		draw the scetch that was saved and simplified: <i>
		draw the scetch that was saved: <u>
	Now as the name here also suggest that with this feature you can save a scetch, in reality you can't. 
	you just save the recorded positions of your circle, then they are being simplified (because why not?) and by pressing <i> you can draw 
	what you recorded, but if you want to keep the detail of your recording you can press <u>
